# Voice Input Requirements

- Voice input (Telugu transcription) works only on modern browsers: **Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari**.
- You must access the app via `localhost` or HTTPS (not your LAN IP without HTTPS).
- When prompted, you must allow microphone access.
- If you see a 'browser not supported' message, switch to a supported browser and/or use the correct URL.
